### What Are Client/Serving Techniques?

> Client/Serving Techniques define how you interact with or deploy LLMs in your app or workflow. Whether you’re calling a remote API like GPT-3.5, embedding a model in the browser, or running it locally—these methods help you choose the right setup based on **cost**, **latency**, **privacy**, and **flexibility**.

---

### 1. MCP Client (Multi-Chain Prompting)

**Multi-Chain Prompting** allows you to break down a complex task into multiple smaller prompts and process them in sequence. This technique:

- Increases reasoning accuracy
- Enables multi-step workflows
- Works well even with free-tier GPT models

📌 **Example Idea (using GPT-3.5 Free Pack)**:
```bash
Prompt 1: "List 3 main problems in modern education."
Prompt 2: "Pick one problem and propose 3 innovative solutions."
Prompt 3: "Write an executive summary combining the chosen problem and its best solution."
```

🛠 **Free Tools**:
- Any GPT-Free playground (like Poe, OpenRouter, or HuggingChat)
- Basic script using `fetch()` or `axios` in Node.js

---

### 2. LangChain (Free-Mode Setup)

LangChain allows chaining prompts, agents, and tools with LLMs. You can use LangChain with **OpenAI's free tier** or any free LLM API (like DeepSeek or Cohere’s trial key).

🧪 **Use Cases**:
- Multi-step document Q&A
- Code explanation pipeline
- LLM-based agents

🔧 **Free Integration**:
```bash
npm install langchain
```

🛠 **Use free LLM endpoints**, like:
- OpenRouter.ai (GPT-3.5 Free access)
- DeepSeek Free API

---

### 3. Using GPT-Free Clients (OpenAI SDK Alternatives)

You can interact with free LLMs using basic HTTP clients or SDKs:

🔌 **Examples**:
- `curl` or Postman to hit free endpoints
- `node-fetch` / `axios` in Node.js
- Python requests with free models like:
  - **OpenRouter.ai**
  - **HuggingChat (unofficial APIs)**
  - **Free trial on OpenAI (if available)**

🌐 **Tip**: Always monitor rate limits!

---

### 4. WebLLM (Running LLMs in the Browser)

Run LLMs **locally in the browser** using WebAssembly and WebGPU. Perfect for:

- No-server apps
- Educational offline tools
- Full user privacy

🌍 **Project**: [WebLLM by MLC](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm)

🛠️ **Run a 1B+ model like Vicuna or LLaMA in-browser**:
```html
<script src="webllm.js"></script>
<script>
  await webllm.chat("Explain what is quantum computing");
</script>
```

---

### 5. Local Models (Offline LLM Clients)

Use local models like:
- **GPT4All**
- **Ollama**
- **LM Studio**
- **Text Generation Web UI**

🧠 Use cases:
- No internet required
- Control over data
- Faster prototyping (no rate limits)

📦 Recommended Models:
- Mistral-7B
- TinyLLaMA
- DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B (for code)

---

### 6. Bonus: HuggingFace Inference API (Free Tier)

HuggingFace offers free-tier APIs for thousands of hosted models.

🧪 **Try This**:
```bash
curl https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-free-token>" \
  -d '{"inputs": "Tell me a fun fact about cats"}'
```
