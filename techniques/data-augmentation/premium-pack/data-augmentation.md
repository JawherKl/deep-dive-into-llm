### What Are Data Augmentation Techniques?

> These techniques **augment LLM capabilities** by providing access to dynamic knowledge bases, long-term memory, and advanced prompt injection. Premium LLMs offer **larger context windows, better reasoning**, and **longer memory**, making these techniques extremely effective in high-stakes or high-volume environments.

---

### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**RAG combines LLMs with search engines or vector databases**, allowing them to answer questions using up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge.

🧠 With GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini Advanced, RAG enables:
- Enterprise Q&A over millions of docs
- Source-aware responses (with citations)
- Semantic search + structured generation

🛠️ **Tech Stack**:
- 🧠 **LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro
- 📚 **Retrieval**: LangChain + Weaviate / Pinecone / Vespa
- 🗂 **Indexing**: Chunking + Embedding + Metadata

✅ **Example Flow (LangChain + GPT-4)**:
```js
1. User asks: "Explain the key legal risks in GDPR"
2. Search PDF docs in Weaviate vector DB
3. Inject top 3 matches into GPT-4 prompt
4. Response includes citations and references
```

### 2. FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder)

Premium models like GPT-4-Turbo and Claude 3 can **accept massive context windows (100K+)**, enabling Fusion-in-Decoder naturally.

💡 Instead of selecting only one doc:
- Inject *dozens* of relevant documents
- Let the model **fuse them** inside the generation phase
- No need for external reranking heuristics

📌 **Real-World Use**:
> Claude 3 takes 10+ search results, filters redundant facts, and returns a single, coherent answer with pros/cons, examples, and structured output—all within one call.

📦 Recommended for:
- Legal analysis
- Medical Q&A
- Financial summaries

### 3. Memory-Augmented Models

Premium models + infrastructure unlock **true long-term memory**.

🔄 Integrate:
- Conversation memory (persistent via vector DBs)
- Session summaries injected into every new prompt
- Hybrid memory: short-term (last X tokens) + long-term (past months/years)

🧠 Best Models:
- GPT-4-Turbo (function-calling + memory)
- Claude Opus (system prompts + long-term context)
- Gemini Advanced (contextual memory & tools)

🛠 Example Setup:
- Redis + LangChain Memory + GPT-4
- Memory summary injection every 3 turns
- Role-specific memory modules (e.g., assistant, planner, coder)

### 4. Prompt Tuning / Soft Prompting (Premium Models)

With access to high-quality model APIs, prompt tuning can be taken further:

### 🧩 Options:
1. **Custom System Prompts**: Instruct Claude or GPT-4 with domain-specific tone + behavior.
2. **Function Calling + Structured Prompts**: Use OpenAI’s JSON schema enforcement to control responses.
3. **Soft Embedding Injection (e.g. LoRA/PEFT)**: Tune models using libraries like 🤗 PEFT and deploy via paid APIs.

📌 Claude Example Prompt:
```yaml
You are a senior legal consultant. Write structured summaries using the format:
- 📄 Key Risk:
- 📌 Regulation:
- ✅ Mitigation Strategy:
```

📌 GPT-4 Function Calling:
```json
"function": {
  "name": "search_summary",
  "parameters": {
    "topic": "string",
    "length": "short | medium | long"
  }
}
```
