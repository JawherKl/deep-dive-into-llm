### What Are Fine-Tuning Techniques?

> Fine-tuning allows you to **adapt a pre-trained LLM** to a specific task, domain, or personality using additional training data. With efficient techniques like LoRA or PEFT, you can fine-tune large models **on a laptop or a free Colab notebook**!

---

### 1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

LoRA freezes the original LLM weights and inserts small **trainable adapter layers**, drastically reducing the number of parameters you train.

✅ **Benefits**:
- Requires fewer resources
- Can be trained in Google Colab (free)
- Reusable and stackable adapters

🧪 **Free Setup**:
- Use HuggingFace + 🤗 `peft` + `transformers`
- Try it on 7B models like Mistral or LLaMA2

📦 Sample Command (Colab):
```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
model = get_peft_model(base_model, LoraConfig(task_type="CAUSAL_LM"))
```

### 2. PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)

PEFT is a general class of techniques like LoRA, prefix tuning, and prompt tuning that minimize GPU and memory usage.

🌟 Ideal for:
- Fine-tuning on small data (like 100–1,000 samples)
- Fast iterations on domain-specific tasks

📚 Tools:
- HuggingFace `peft` library
- Google Colab + T4 GPU (free)

📌 Example Use Cases:
- Custom chatbot behavior
- Fine-tuned medical Q&A assistant

---

### 3. Instruction Tuning

Teach the model how to behave by training it on **examples of instructions + expected completions**.

🧠 Use Datasets Like:
- [OpenAssistant](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1)
- [FLAN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu)
- [Dolly](https://huggingface.co/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k)

📦 Example Format:
```json
{
  "instruction": "Translate the following English text to French.",
  "input": "Where is the nearest bakery?",
  "output": "Où se trouve la boulangerie la plus proche ?"
}
```

🛠 Train using `transformers` + `datasets` with your favorite model like `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct`.

---

### 4. Delta Tuning (Diff-Based Models)

Rather than uploading full fine-tuned weights (which can be huge), you publish **just the difference** between the base model and your trained version.

✅ This saves:
- Storage space
- Hosting costs
- Load time

🧰 Tools:
- `transformers-cli` for uploading deltas
- HuggingFace `diffusers` or `peft` APIs

🧪 Used in: Alpaca, Vicuna, and many open fine-tuned LLMs on HuggingFace.

---

### 5. QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)

QLoRA is the upgraded, ultra-efficient version of LoRA that works with **4-bit quantized models**.

💡 This means you can fine-tune large models **with just 8–16 GB of RAM** — even on a laptop or Colab!

📦 Tools:
- `bitsandbytes` (for quantization)
- `peft`, `transformers`, and `accelerate`

🧪 Colab Sample:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B", quantization_config=bnb_config)
```

## 🧩 Conclusion

With the help of **LoRA, PEFT, QLoRA, and Instruction Tuning**, it's now possible to fine-tune powerful LLMs for **specific tasks and use cases** — even with limited hardware and free-tier resources.

These methods unlock new levels of customization and control, whether you're building chatbots, data assistants, or creative writing AIs.
