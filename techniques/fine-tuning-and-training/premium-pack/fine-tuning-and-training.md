### Overview

> In premium setups, fine-tuning means **you own the performance**. You adapt foundation models to your own tone, vocabulary, dataset, and task flow — all while enjoying scalable infrastructure, security, and monitoring.

---

### 1. OpenAI Fine-Tuning

✅ Fine-tune **GPT-3.5-turbo** and other models using OpenAI’s managed APIs.

📦 Use Cases:
- Branding and tone control
- Specialized Q&A bots
- Custom completions (like structured responses)

🛠 Fine-Tuning Workflow:
```bash
# Step 1: Prepare your dataset
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data.jsonl

# Step 2: Upload & train
openai api fine_tunes.create -t "data_prepared.jsonl" -m gpt-3.5-turbo

# Step 3: Inference
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:your-org::abc123",
  messages=[...]
)
```

🔐 Includes secure storage, monitoring, rate-limiting, and version control.

### 2. Anthropic Fine-Tuning (Coming Soon)

🚧 As of now, **Claude 3** and earlier models don’t offer public fine-tuning APIs — but support is planned for enterprise customers.

💡 Alternatives:
- Use **system prompts** with premium token context windows (up to 200k+ tokens!)
- Store custom instructions in a backend or vector DB
- Combine with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

### 3. HuggingFace Endpoints & AutoTrain

HuggingFace offers **fully managed fine-tuning** via:
- **AutoTrain** (No-code UI)
- **Custom Training Jobs** (Code-based)

📦 Example Use Cases:
- Multi-lingual chatbots
- E-commerce product describers
- Domain-specific document readers

🔥 Premium Features:
- GPU training jobs (A100, T4)
- Private hosting endpoints
- CI/CD for models
- Dashboards and logs

🧪 Code Sample (SDK):
```python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

api = HfApi()
api.create_repo("your-org/finance-gpt")
api.upload_file(path_or_fileobj="trained_model.bin", path_in_repo="pytorch_model.bin")
```

### 4. Azure OpenAI + Custom Models

Microsoft Azure provides **enterprise-grade fine-tuning** for GPT models with deep integration into:
- Active Directory
- Azure Storage
- Private Virtual Networks (VPN)

🛠 Key Features:
- Model monitoring via Azure Monitor
- Custom deployment slots
- Fine-tune GPT-3.5 using Azure CLI or SDK

📚 Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/

---

### 5. Amazon Bedrock + Model Customization

Use Amazon Bedrock to fine-tune models from **Anthropic, AI21, Cohere, and Meta** with an easy UI or programmatically via SDK.

📌 Highlights:
- Private model copies
- Integration with S3, SageMaker, and Lambda
- Pay-per-use pricing

📦 Example Workflow:
```json
{
  "modelId": "ai21.j2-ultra",
  "trainingData": "s3://my-dataset/",
  "outputLocation": "s3://my-output/"
}
```

🔒 Enterprise security and IAM included.

---

### 6. Advanced PEFT with NVIDIA Triton & DeepSpeed

For high-performance fine-tuning on private GPUs, combine:
- **DeepSpeed** for memory optimization
- **NVIDIA Triton** for inference serving
- **LoRA + QLoRA** for fast training

💡 Use this for:
- Running 13B–70B models
- Real-time fine-tuned inference at scale
- Fine-tuning multiple tasks with minimal hardware

🧰 Tools:
- `accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`, `peft`, `deepspeed`, `flash-attention`

📚 See: [NVIDIA Triton Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server)
